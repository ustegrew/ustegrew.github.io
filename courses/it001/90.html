                    Be aware that the understanding on expressions in this course is deviating from the understanding

                    The official definition of an "expression" also resembles the definition of "expression" in 
                    mathematics which is

                <p>
                    Also, our understanding of the word "term" is a little bit different from the understanding in mathematics. 
                    Unfortunately, the mathematical understanding of "term" does not have much practical relevance in programming.
                    In mathematics, a "term" is
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
                    parts of an expression or series separated by <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> signs, or the parts of a sequence separated by commas.

                </div>
                <p>
                    In this course, when we talk of an "expression" we really mean an <i>assignment</i>, and when we talk of a "term" 
                    then we mean the construct to the right hand side of the <tt>=</tt> sign. When talking about the more mathematical 
                    side of programming we purposely use "expression", and not "assignment". "Expression" has a closer connotation 
                    with "a mathematical operation" whilst "assignment" is more related to "an instruction to be executed". 
                    The area of expressions deals more with the mathematical concepts of programming than with instructions and 
                    what they do.

                <p>
                    As per official definitions, "expression" and "term" isn't easy to distinguish. 
                    In mathematics, a term is part of an expression, but also is an expression 
                    in itself. It's not so problematic in mathematics, because there we use equations, 
                    not just assignments. In an equation it's legal to have operators and terms on both 
                    sides of the <tt>=</tt> sign:
                </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    3b + 1 = b + 15
&lt;=&gt; b = 7
</pre>
                <p>
                    However, in programming we don't have equations, only assignments! And it's important to 
                    distinguish between the entire assignment (here called "expression") and the right hand side 
                    of the assignment (here called "term"). This distinction is important, because we strongly
                    discourage the use of expressions where terms should be used. This practice can lead to side effects 
                    and produce hard-to-maintain code. Here are a few examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Chained expressions</b> - avoid these, as they have hidden side effects, especially when
                            using them as part of a variable declaration:
                        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var a = b = 5;
</pre>
                        <p>
                            Whilst this is a great shorthand syntax, it creates implicit global variables. Consider this:
                        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var bar = 'funky';
var baz = 'disco';

(function helloworld() {
    var foo = bar = baz = 'local';
    console.log(foo); // local
    console.log(bar); // local
    console.log(baz); // local
}());

console.log(bar);// local, I thought it would be funky
console.log(baz);// local, I thought it would be disco
</pre>
                        <p>
                            We discourage chained expressions. They should be split up in separate expressions with just 
                            terms on the right hand side.
                        </p>

                            <b>Expressions instead of terms</b> - Leading to some monstrocities such as these:

<pre class="prettyprint">
a = 3 + (b = 5);
</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
b = (a > 5)  ?  c = 3; c = 4;
</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
if (b = 4) 
{
    /* do something */ 
};
</pre>
                        <p>
                            These are notoriously bad, because they have side effects and make the code harder to 
                            understand - potentially leading to buggy and unmaintainable code. Therefore we simply 
                            cut through these issues by making a distinction between terms and expressions and 
                            saying: "Don't use expressions where terms should be used!" This gives students just 
                            that bit better foundation to write safer and more maintainable code!

                <p>
                    Whilst it's unfortunate that our understanding of "expression" and "term" in this course deviates 
                    from the official definitions, we hope that the redefinitions help the student to better know how 
                    to use terms and expressions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope that there will be the positive net effect of a better understanding of the <i>concepts</i> 
                    behind expressions and terms in programming, helping the student to write better 
                    (i.e. less error prone and more maintainable) code.
