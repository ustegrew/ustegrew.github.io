                <h1>A tour of the Javascript language</h1>
                <p>
                    Javascript is a scripting computer language, most commonly used within web browsers. It
                    is a dynamic language which means that it performs many tasks during runtime (dynamically) 
                    which static languages perform during compile time. For example, a Javascript program
                    can change itself which is very difficult to do with static languages. The Javascript
                    syntax is influenced by the C language, and it supports many features of other programming 
                    languages.<br/>                    
                    Javascript runs mostly within a web browser, but it also is used in PDF documents and 
                    even as part of server side web applications.<br/>
                </p>
                <h2>Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript supports many of the concepts that underlie modern programming languages: 
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Statements</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A <em>statement</em> expresses some action to be carried out. It will often change the 
                            internal state of a program, e.g. when a variable value is changed. There are different 
                            kinds of statements, for example assignments, or, function calls.<br/>
                            Here are some example statements:
<pre class="prettyprint">
var n;                          /* Variable declaration                  */
var r = 20;                     /* Variable declaration and definition   */
n = 100;                        /* Simple assignment                     */
n = 2 * r;                      /* Assignment with multiplication term   */
r = Math.sqrt (16)              /* Assignment with function call         */
if (r == 10) r = 0;             /* Control flow statement                */
window.alert ("Hello World");   /* Show message box                      */
</pre>
                            <div class="tryitout">
                                <button onclick="Exec_01 ();">

                                </button>
                            </div>

                        <dd>
                            A <em>variable</em> is a container for a value. That value might be a number, a string, or 
                            some other object. A variable always has a particular <em>variable type</em>. This is
                            the kind of data held by that variable. For example, a variable of type <tt>integer</tt>
                            holds a whole number whilst a variable of type <tt>string</tt> holds a sequence of
                            characters.
<pre class="prettyprint">
a = 5;          /* a will be of type integer and hold the value 5       */
b = "Hello";    /* b will be of type string  and hold the value "Hello" */
</pre>
                            <div class="related-info">

                        <dd>
                            Like in mathematics, an <em>operator</em> indicates a specific operation on one or more
                            operands. A <em>term</em> is a combination of one or more operations. For example, in the 
                            term <tt>2 + 3</tt> the addition operator '+' denotes the addition of the two operands, 
                            <tt>2</tt> and <tt>3</tt> yielding the result <tt>5</tt>.
                            <div class="related-info">
                                For more info, see the chapters on <a href="05.html">operators and expressions</a>.
                            </div>

                        <dt>Expressions</dt>
                        <dd>
                            An <em>expression</em> is a combination of values, operators and functions producing 
                            a value. For example, the expression <tt>y=2*a</tt> would double the value stored in the
                            variable <tt>a</tt> and store the result in the variable <tt>y</tt>. The concept of 
                            expressions is borrowed from algebra. Examples:
<pre class="prettyprint">
x = 10;                     /* Assign value 10 to variable x             */
t = "SomeString";           /* Assign value "SomeString" to variable t   */
y = 2 * x * x  +  32;       /* Compute polynomial value 2*x^2 + 32,      */
                            /* store result in variable y                */
z = computemyvalue (23);    /* Call user defined function computemyvalue */
                            /* passing 23 as parameter and assign result */
                            /* to variable z                             */
</pre>
                            <div class="related-info">
                                For more info, see the chapters on <a href="05.html">operators and expressions</a>.
                            </div>
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Control flow</dt>
                        <dd>
                            The <em>control flow</em> of a program refers to the order in which the individual 
                            statements are executed. A program may just contain a list of statements; these will be 
                            executed in the order they are written. Most times a program will contain statements which 
                            change the execution sequence. For example, the <tt>if</tt> statement changes the execution 
                            sequence, depending on a condition.  There are other statements which change the flow of 
                            execution, such as loops or breaks.
<pre class="prettyprint">
a = 10;
b =  0;

/* Conditional execution */
if (a &lt; 5)
    b = 1;
else
    b = 2;

/* b will be 2 */   
window.alert ("b = " + b);

                            <div class="tryitout">

                        <dt>Structured programming</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <em>Structured programming</em> organizes a program into blocks of code. This 
                            increases clarity and readability of the program's source code. For example, consider 
                            this program written in unstructured code in BASIC:
<pre class="prettyprint">
a=1000
point1:
if a&lt;=1 then goto end
if (a/2)=int(a/2) then goto point2
a=3*a+1
goto point1
point2:
a=a/2
goto point1
end:
print "Finished!"
</pre>
                            Rather humorously, this kind of code is also called "spaghetti code". Compare it with 
                            this equivalent structured BASIC code:
<pre class="prettyprint">
a=1000
while a >= 2
    if (a/2) = int(a/2) then
        a=a/2
    else
        a=3*a+1
    end if
wend
print "Finished!"
</pre>
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Functions</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A <em>function</em> is a unit of code which performs a specific task. This unit 
                            can then be used in programs wherever that particular task needs to be performed. Often a 
                            function can also be used to compute some value and make it available to the 
                            program using the function. Without the programming tool of functions there would be much
                            repetition of code (and errors), resulting in much extra work. The use of functions 
                            can significantly reduce the cost of developing and maintaining computer programs. Example:
<pre class="prettyprint">
function CheckValue (x)
{
    if (x &lt; 10)
        window.alert ("Love the number " + x + "!");
    else
        window.alert ("You doofus! I hate the number " + x + "!");
}

CheckValue (5);       /* Bring up message box showing 'Love the number 5!'                */
CheckValue (20);      /* Bring up message box showing 'You doofus! I hate the number 20!' */
</pre>
                            Without function, the program would have looked like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
x = 5;
if (x &lt; 10)
    window.alert ("Love the number " + x + "!");
else
    window.alert ("You doofus! I hate the number " + x + "!");

x = 20;
if (x &lt; 10)
    window.alert ("Love the number " + x + "!");
else
    window.alert ("You doofus! I hate the number " + x + "!");
</pre>
                            <div class="tryitout">
                                <button onclick="Exec_07 ();">

                    Javascript has got some additional features found in fewer programming languages:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Dynamic types</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Like in most scripting languages, Javascript uses <em>dynamic data types</em>. 
                            For example, a variable <tt>x</tt> can be defined as a number and later rebound 
                            to a string:
<pre class="prettyprint">
var a = 3;          /* a will be an integer                                */
a = 3.54;           /* Now it's a floating point variable!                 */
a = "Hello"         /* Whoopsie! Now it's a string 'This is my number: 15' */
</pre>
                            <div class="related-info">
                                For more info, see the chapters on <a href="04.html">variables</a>.

                            Classes and objects touch the area of <em>object oriented programming</em>. An 
                            <em>object</em> is a structure loaded into the computer's memory which combines data 
                            and behaviour in one unit. It's a "piece of data which can do things." A <em>class</em>
                            is the recipe which tells the computer how to create a particular object in memory. 
                            It's a construct which contains variables and functions. A class is to an object what
                            a cooking recipe is to a meal.

                        <dd>
                            Javascript always runs as an <em>interpreted language</em> which means that 
                            Javascript source code is directly executed by an interpreter without being compiled
                            beforehand.

                <h2>Syntax</h2>
                <p>
                    Like any language, Javascript has rules what to write where. These rules are called 
                    the <em>syntax</em> rules of the language. Even more than in written natural languages it 
                    is important that these rules are followed carefully if we want the program to work
                    as intended. The computer doesn't have the intelligence to guess what some code means
                    if the code isn't written properly! If Javascript code doesn't follow the syntax rules 
                    then the program will either fail completely or show unexpected behaviour. Here's an 
                    example of good and faulty syntax:
<pre class="prettyprint">
/* Syntax correct */
a = 3;

/* Faulty syntax (missing semicolon at the line end) */
a = 3
</pre>
                    <div class="related-info">
                        For more info on syntax, see the chapter on <a href="03.html">statements</a>.
                    </div>
                </p>
                <h2>Practically...</h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript is very easy to use! All that is needed is a text editor to write the 
                    program code and a web browser to execute it. The setup for this course is a bit
                    more elaborate, but that is not a requirement to produce Javascript programs.
