            <h1>Programming with Javascript</h1>
            <p>
                This short course offers an introduction into programming in general, using Javascript 
                as vehicle. Even though Javascript runs within a web browser we won't attempt to talk 
                much about web design, HTML pages etc. This would go beyond the scope of the course.
                Instead we will concentrate on concepts which Javascript is based on. These concepts 
                are shared by many other programming languages. Hopefully this will make it easier 
                to venture out into the open and to learn programming in other languages.
            </p>

                You will need access to a computer with a Google Chrome (version 30 and above) installed. 
                You will use Google Chrome to test and debug the Javascript code you work on. For a guide
