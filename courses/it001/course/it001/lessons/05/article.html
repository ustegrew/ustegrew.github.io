            <h1>Variables</h1>
            <p>
                In mathematics, a variable is a <i>named placeholder</i> for some quantity. 
                In computing, a variable is a <i>named container</i> for information. In 
                most cases, this information is simply data such as numbers or text. A variable 
                is like a bucket with a name written on it (<em>variable name</em>) and 
                something in it (<em>value</em>).

            <h2>Variable names</h2>
            <p>
                As a variable is a named container we need to note the rules applying to variable names. 
                These rules apply to names in other contexts - most notably, function
                names. We won't get into all the details of proper names in Javascript, but present a 
                rule of thumb which represents good practice across several programming languages:<br/>
                A name should
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Start with a letter or underscore:<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>a</tt> .. <tt>z</tt>, 
                        <tt>A</tt> .. <tt>Z</tt>, <tt>_</tt>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Followed by a sequence of letters, digits and underscores:<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>a</tt>..<tt>z</tt>, 
                        <tt>A</tt>..<tt>Z</tt>, <tt>0</tt>..<tt>9</tt>, <tt>_</tt>
                </li>
                    
            </ul>

            <h2>Declaration and definition</h2>
            <p>
                Before a variable can be used it must be <em>declared</em> and 
                <em>defined</em>.
            </p>

            
            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Declaration</h3>
            <p>
                The <em>declaration</em> announces the existence of the variable
                to the Javascript system. As soon as the Javascript system finds a 
                declaration it sets storage aside for the resp. variable. This is 
                like getting the bucket out of the cupboard. You declare a
                variable with the keyword <tt>var</tt>.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x;
                </pre>
            </div>                                
            <p>
                You could omit the keyword and simply assign the value,
                but this can introduce problems and should not be used.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    x = 3;
                </pre>
            </div>                                
            <div class="note">
                Always use <tt>var</tt> when declaring variables.
            </div>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>
                A variable can't be used if it's just declared. We say that the
                variable is <i>undefined</i>. Just declaring an variable is like 
                getting an empty bucket out. An empty bucket offers no useful 
                content. To make the variable useable we need to set it to some 
                initial value. This setting to some initial value is called the
                <em>definition</em>.

            <p>
                A <em>literal</em> is a fixed value in source code. Such fixed data is needed
                very often. Example uses would be definitions, or, calculations.

            <p>
                Most programming languages provide basic, inbuilt data types. Such

            <p>
                Many languages provide data types in which one or more primitive 
                elements are bound together in one unit. Such types are called 
                <em>composite</em> types. The area of composite types has a lot 
                to do with the area of <em>object oriented programming</em>.

            <h2>Weakly typed</h2>
            <p>
                Javascript does not fix any variable as to which type it has. The 
                type of a variable depends on its content. This means, when we 
                change a variable's content during run time it may change it's 
                type with it. This makes Javascript a <em>weakly typed</em> language.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_030">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x = 3;
                    console.log ("x = 3,         type of x is: " + typeof (x));

                    x = 3.2;
                    console.log ("x = 3.2,       type of x is: " + typeof (x));

                    x = "Hello";
                    console.log ("x = 'Hello',   type of x is: " + typeof (x));

                    x = true;
                    console.log ("x = true,      type of x is: " + typeof (x));

            </div>

            <p>
                The "weak types" feature is particular to the Javascript language, as
                well as some others. There are languages which are <em>strongly typed</em>, 
                such as C++. In C++, trying to assign a string to an integer variable 
                will result in a compiler error:

            <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>
                There are tasks for which simple variables aren't sufficient. 
                Here some example tasks:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting a list of integers.</li>
                    <li>Finding the average over a number of measurements.</li>
                    <li>Searching for an entry in a list of names.</li>
                    <li>Finding the shortest route between two cities.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                All these tasks have in common that they need to perform a particular 
                operation on a group of related data items (e.g. a list of numbers). 
                The resp. task becomes even harder to solve when the number of 
                items is unknown at programming time!
                One of the structures which makes group operations possible is 
                the <em>array</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>An array is...</h3>
            <p>
                An array is an ordered, named, indexable collection of elements with
                a finite amount of data. In detail: An array is...
                <dl>
                    <dt>A collection</dt>

            <h3>Creating an array</h3>
            <p>
                Like all variables, arrays need to be declared <i>and</i> defined. There are
                different ways of defining arrays in Javascript, but we won't handle them
                all. The notation we will use here is the square bracket notation. Here we
                create the Javascript equivalent of the above array of buckets:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_040">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var buckets = [10, 25, 16, 45];
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                This creates a new array called <tt>buckets</tt> and fills it with four elements
                in the order in which they appear inside the brackets: <tt>10</tt>,
                <tt>25</tt>, <tt>16</tt>, <tt>45</tt>. This order will not change, unless 
                explicitly done by programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Array elements don't all need to be of the same type. It's possible to mix
                variable types in an array.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_050">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x = [15, true, "I am element #2", null];
                    console.log ("x: " + typeof (x[0]) + ", " + typeof (x[1]) + ", " + 
                                         typeof (x[2]) + ", " + typeof (x[3])          );
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                It's also possible to create empty array elements by using an empty comma 
                ('<tt>,</tt>'). The empty element will be set to <tt>undefined</tt>. The
                resulting array is called a <em>sparse array</em>. More about sparse arrays 
                below.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_060">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x = [1, , 2];
                    console.log (x [1]);
                </pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Array literals</h3>
            <p>
                An Array is defined using an array literal. The literal is a list of values enclosed 
                in square brackets <tt>[]</tt>.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_070">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var a = [];                 /* Empty array                                          */
                    var b = [20];               /* Array with  one element                              */
                    var c = [1, "Hello"];       /* Array with two elements, each of a different type    */
                    var d = [ [1, 2], [5, 6] ]; /* Array with two sub arrays as elements (table)        */

            <h3>Accessing array elements</h3>
            <p>
                Array elements can be accessed by index. The index is an integer number 
                and has to be written in square brackets <tt>[]</tt>. The first element
                has the index <tt>0</tt> (zero), the second index has the value <tt>1</tt>
                and so on. The last element has the index of one less than the number 
                of elements stored in the array.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_080">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x = [10, 25, 16, 45];
                    console.log ("x: " + x [0] + ", " + x [1] + ", " + x [2] + ", " + x [3]);

                    x [0] = 98765432;
                    console.log ("x: " + x [0] + ", " + x [1] + ", " + x [2] + ", " + x [3]);

            <h4>Sparse arrays</h4>
            <p>
                In Javascript, it is possible to create <em>sparse arrays</em>.
                These are arrays with holes in them. In the following example
                we are creating an array with a hole at position <tt>1</tt>
                (second element). This means that the second element will be
                <tt>undefined</tt>.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_090">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x = [];     /* Creates an empty array                   */

                    x [0] = 1;      /* Set first array element...               */
                    x [2] = 100;    /* Oops, we're skipping the second element! */
                                    /* Now, our array has a hole                */
                                    /* at position #1 !                         */
                </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="note">
                Sparse arrays are used in Javascript and some other languages. 
                We just mention then as a matter of information - and won't treat 
                them in more detail.

            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Getting the size of the array</h3>
            <p>
                One often needed piece of information about an array is how many elements
                it has stored. This is provided by the <tt>length</tt> property.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_05_100">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var x = [5, 1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 3];
                    console.log ("number of elements stored in array x: " + x.length);
                </pre>
