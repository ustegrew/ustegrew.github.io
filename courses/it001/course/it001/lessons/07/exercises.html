                    To create random numbers, computers use so-called Pseudo
                    Random Number Generators (PRNG). These produce a stream 
                    of random looking numbers. However, these numbers aren't 
                    really random. Here are some features which distinguish
                    a PRNG from a real random generator (such as an ideal dice, 
                    or, an ideal coin):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        PRNGs have got a finite sequence length. This means, a PRNG 
                        generates a finite sequence of "random" numbers and will repeat 
                        this sequence infinitely (e.g. <tt>4, 2, 9, 4, 2, 9, 4...</tt>. 
                        The amount of numbers in the sequence is called the 
                        <em>sequence length</em> of the random generator. The smaller 
                        the sequence length the more predictable the generator. Good 
                        PRNGs have got a very large sequence length!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PRNGs don't produce all numbers with the same likelihood. Some 
                        numbers occur more often than others. In other words, a PRNG
                        has an skewed <em>number distribution</em>. A good PRNG
                        has got very little skew, i.e. it produces all its numbers 
                        with very much the same likelihood.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    In this exercise we will study different random number generaters and 
                    assess their quality. We'll be using the following framework code for the
                    generators:
                </p>
                <div class="example">

                        do
                        {
                            <font class="emphasize-chars">random generator expression</font>
                        }
                        while (<font class="emphasize-chars">continue-condition</font>);
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We'll always set the initial value to <tt>5461</tt>.
                    For each random generator below, your task is to...

                        Find out which number is produced how often.

                    Unfortunately, loads of customers pay in ten pound notes! He always tries 
                    to give the return money with as few coins as possible, but it's really 
                    hard for him to work out how to get the right mix of coins for each 
                    customer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you help poor Fido and write a program which computes the minimum amount of 
                    &pound;1, 50p, 20p, and, 10p coins he needs to give back to the customer?
