            <h1>A tour of the Javascript language</h1>
            <p>
                Javascript is a scripting computer language, most commonly used within web browsers. It
                is a dynamic language which means that it performs many tasks during runtime (dynamically) 
                which static languages perform during compile time. For example, a Javascript program
                can change itself which is very difficult to do with static languages. The Javascript
                syntax is influenced by the C language, and it supports many features of other programming 
                languages.<br/>                    
                Javascript runs mostly within a web browser, but it also is used in PDF documents and 
                even as part of server side web applications.<br/>

            <h3>Statements</h3>
            <p>
                A <em>statement</em> expresses some action to be carried out. It will often change the 
                internal state of a program, e.g. when a variable value is changed. There are different 
                kinds of statements, for example assignments, or, function calls. Here are some 
                example statements:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_010">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var n;                          /* Variable declaration                  */
                    var r = 20;                     /* Variable declaration and definition   */
                    n = 100;                        /* Simple assignment                     */
                    n = 2 * r;                      /* Assignment with multiplication term   */
                    r = Math.sqrt (16)              /* Assignment with function call         */
                    if (r == 4) r = 0;              /* Control flow statement                */
                    window.alert ("Hello World");   /* Show message box                      */
                </pre>
            </div>

            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>
                A <em>variable</em> is a container for a value. That value might be a number, a string, or 
                some other object. A variable always has a particular <em>variable type</em>. This is
                the kind of data held by that variable. For example, a variable of type <tt>integer</tt>
                holds a whole number whilst a variable of type <tt>string</tt> holds a sequence of
                characters.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_020">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    a = 5;          /* a will be of type integer and hold the value 5       */
                    b = "Hello";    /* b will be of type string  and hold the value "Hello" */
                </pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Operators and terms</h3>
            <p>
                Like in mathematics, an <em>operator</em> indicates a specific operation on one or more
                operands. A <em>term</em> is a combination of one or more operations. For example, in the 
                term <tt>2 + 3</tt> the addition operator '+' denotes the addition of the two operands, 
                <tt>2</tt> and <tt>3</tt> yielding the result <tt>5</tt>.
            </p>
            <div class="related-info">

            <h3>Expressions</h3>
            <p>
                An <em>expression</em> is a combination of values, operators and functions producing 
                a value. For example, the expression <tt>y=2*a</tt> would double the value stored in the
                variable <tt>a</tt> and store the result in the variable <tt>y</tt>. The concept of 
                expressions is borrowed from algebra. Examples:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_030">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    x = 10;                     /* Assign value 10 to variable x             */
                    t = "SomeString";           /* Assign value "SomeString" to variable t   */
                    y = 2 * x * x  +  32;       /* Compute polynomial value 2*x^2 + 32,      */
                                                /* store result in variable y                */
                    z = computemyvalue (23);    /* Call user defined function computemyvalue */
                                                /* passing 23 as parameter and assign result */
                                                /* to variable z                             */
                </pre>
            </div>

            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Control flow</h3>
            <p>
                The <em>control flow</em> of a program refers to the order in which the individual 
                statements are executed. A program may just contain a list of statements; these will be 
                executed in the order they are written. Most times a program will contain statements which 
                change the execution sequence. For example, the <tt>if</tt> statement changes the execution 
                sequence, depending on a condition.  There are other statements which change the flow of 
                execution, such as loops or breaks.
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_040">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    a = 10;
                    b =  0;

                    /* Conditional execution */
                    if (a &lt; 5)
                        b = 1;
                    else
                        b = 2;

                    /* b will be 2 */   
                    window.alert ("b = " + b);
                    </pre>
            </div>

            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Structured programming</h3>
            <p>
                <em>Structured programming</em> organizes a program into blocks of code. This 
                increases clarity and readability of the program's source code. For example, consider 
                this program written in unstructured code in old style BASIC:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_050">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    10 a=10
                    20 if a&lt;=1 then goto 80
                    30 if (a/2)=int(a/2) then goto 60
                    40 a=3*a+1
                    50 goto 20
                    60 a=a/2
                    70 goto 20
                    80 print "Finished!"
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                Rather humorously, this kind of code is also called "spaghetti code". Compare it with 
                this equivalent structured BASIC code:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_060">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    a=10
                    while a >= 2
                        if (a/2) = int(a/2) then
                            a=a/2
                        else
                            a=3*a+1
                        end if
                    wend
                    print "Finished!"
                </pre>
            </div>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>
                A <em>function</em> is a unit of code which performs a specific task. This unit 
                can then be used in programs wherever that particular task needs to be performed. Often a 
                function can also be used to compute some value and make it available to the 
                program using the function. Without the programming tool of functions there would be much
                repetition of code (and errors), resulting in much extra work. The use of functions 
                can significantly reduce the cost of developing and maintaining computer programs. Example:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_070">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    function CheckValue (x)
                    {
                        if (x &lt; 10)
                            window.alert ("Love the number " + x + "!");
                        else
                            window.alert ("You doofus! I hate the number " + x + "!");
                    }

                    CheckValue (5);       /* Bring up message box showing 'Love the number 5!'                */
                    CheckValue (20);      /* Bring up message box showing 'You doofus! I hate the number 20!' */
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                Without function, the program would have looked like this:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_080">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    x = 5;
                    if (x &lt; 10)
                        window.alert ("Love the number " + x + "!");
                    else
                        window.alert ("You doofus! I hate the number " + x + "!");

                    x = 20;
                    if (x &lt; 10)
                        window.alert ("Love the number " + x + "!");
                    else
                        window.alert ("You doofus! I hate the number " + x + "!");

            <h2>Other features</h2>
            <p>
                Javascript has got some additional features found in fewer programming languages.
            </p>

            
            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Dynamic types</h3>
            <p>
                Like in most scripting languages, Javascript uses <em>dynamic data types</em>. 
                For example, a variable <tt>x</tt> can be defined as a number and later rebound 
                to a string:
            </p>
            <div class="example" demo-id="it001_Ex_03_090">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    var a = 3;          /* a will be an integer                                */
                    a = 3.54;           /* Now it's a floating point variable!                 */
                    a = "Hello"         /* Whoopsie! Now it's a string 'Hello'                 */

            <h3>Classes and objects</h3>
            <p>
                Classes and objects touch the area of <em>object oriented programming</em>. An 
                <em>object</em> is a structure loaded into the computer's memory which combines data 
                and behaviour in one unit. It's a "piece of data which can do things." A <em>class</em>
                is the recipe which tells the computer how to create a particular object in memory. 
                It's a construct which contains variables and functions. A class is to an object what
                a cooking recipe is to a meal.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                The area of object oriented programming goes beyond the scope of
                this course. Therefore we won't handle this area in any detail.
            </div>

            
            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 3 -------------------------------- -->
            <h3>Interpreted language</h3>
            <p>
                Javascript always runs as an <em>interpreted language</em> which means that 
                Javascript source code is directly executed by an interpreter without being compiled
                beforehand.
            </p>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p>
                Like any language, Javascript has rules what to write where. These rules are called 
                the <em>syntax</em> rules of the language. Even more than in written natural languages it 
                is important that these rules are followed carefully if we want the program to work
                as intended. The computer doesn't have the intelligence to guess what some code means
                if the code isn't written properly! If Javascript code doesn't follow the syntax rules 
                then the program will either fail completely or show unexpected behaviour. Here's an 
                example of good and faulty syntax:
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    /* Syntax correct */
                    a = 3;

                    /* Syntax wrong: Using "becomes" instead of "equal" character ('=') */
                    a becomes 3;
                </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="related-info">
                For more info on syntax, see the chapter on statements.

            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Practically...</h2>
            <p>
                Javascript is very easy to use! All that is needed is a text editor to write the 
                program code and a web browser to execute it. The setup for this course is a bit
                more elaborate, but that is not a requirement to produce Javascript programs.
