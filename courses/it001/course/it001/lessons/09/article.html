            <h1>Problem solving</h1>
            <p>
                Programming is all about solving problems. There isn't any prescribed way how to solve a given problem - 
                it's down to your creativity and sheer patience! Here are some hints how to solve any given computing problem:
            </p>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Recon it!</h2>
            <p>
                According to Wikipedia, "Reconnaissance is the military term for exploring beyond the area occupied 
                by friendly forces to gain vital information about enemy forces or features of the environment for 
                later analysis and/or dissemination. 
                (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance</a>)"<br/>
                Before you work on your given problem, give it some recon time, too! Practically, this means you 
                need to do some research and thinking about it, before you start the coding. To recon! successfully, it 
                often helps to get away from the computer and to go for a walk. Pencil and paper are useful tools! 
                Or, sit somewhere quiet, where you can close your eyes and reflect on the problem. The recon! phase is the 
                most fun, but it can be stressfull, and sometimes you need sheer endurance to keep going.

            <h2>Google!</h2>
            <p>
                These days one of the most important skills is knowing how to use a search engine! Many computing
                problems have already been worked on by other people. Whilst you may not find the solution for
                your given problem, there's a good chance that a search engine will fine some good clues to help you.
            </p>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Be lazy!</h2>
            <p>
                Ugh, terrible suggestion! But if your investigation shows that someone else already wrote software
                for your problem, why doing double work (Unless you write to learn)? Sometimes it's actually better 
                to use other people's work. For example, if you want to use cryptography in your software it's 
                a wise move to use an existing library which offers this functionality, rather than cooking up
                your own scheme. Unless you understand cryptography, your scheme will most likely be compromised!<br/>
                With any library software you must check the license situation - whether you are actually allowed 
                to use the given library for your project!
            </p>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Divide and conquer!</h2>
            <p>
                If you have to move a ton of potatos from A to B, it helps to divide the ton into small portions and move
                the potatos one portion a time. Often a given problem consists of several smaller sub problems. Try to 
                identify whether you can split your problem into sub problems! Then work on the sub problems separately. 
                As a side effect, this will help you to structure your resulting code so the solution is easier to
                undestand for others (incl. yourself ten years later).
            </p>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Capture the future!</h2>
            <p>
                When you write the solution code, try to write more generic code which can be re-used for other projects.
                Over time you will have a library of code ready, and you will find that you'll always have some code handy 
                for the problems given to you then.
            </p>


            <!-- -------------------------------- Heading level 2 -------------------------------- -->
            <h2>Work together!</h2>
            <p>
                You can't be good at everything! Coming back to the ton-of-potatos-example, the task of moving will be 
                even speedier when you ask a few friends to help you! In programming it's similar - if you divide the 
                given problem right you can get a team to solve all the sub problems you identified! And even if you 
                have to wing it alone, you can still talk to others about that problem! Often a second opinion is all
                that's needed for a good solution!
            </p>

            <p>
                Solving problems is exciting and at times frustrating! The skills above don't come cheap, but need to be 
                constantly honed by practice! The most important ingredient in the mix is a love for technical challenges 
                which results in solutions that reflect that love! Too many people work out of love for money. Avoid this 
                trap, but work for the benefit of others! The right heart attitude is more important than all other skills!
