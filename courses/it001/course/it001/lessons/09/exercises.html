                Just for these exercises, <b>disregard</b> the advice to <i>Google!</i> or 
                <i>Be Lazy!</i> As a student you won't benefit from a ready made solution! However, 
                I encourage you to use a search engine to research basic information when you need to do so. For 
                example, for the exercise about <a target="_blank" href="#ex_stackitup">stacks</a>, you may want to find some more 
                information on what stacks are before you start planning your program.

            <h2>Fractinello!</h2>
            <p>
                No worries - this is not a call to invent a new flavour of italian ice cream! However, what 
                I'd like you to do is to write a program which adds two fractions! The program must present 
                the result in its simplest and creamiest form, like Mr. Fractinello!s Vanilla Milli! 
                Examples:<br/>

            <h2>Number land!</h2>
            <p>
                Write a program which converts a positive decimal integer number into a number in another 
                number system. For the target system we allow bases between <tt>1</tt> and <tt>16</tt>. For
                example, if we want to convert the decimal number 25 into its septinary (base 7) equivalent, 
                the program would show the value 34.
            </p>

            <h2>Convert it!</h2>
            <p>
                Javascript provides a function <tt>parseInt (str)</tt> which converts a numerical string into
                a number. Write a program which does the same. The program must reject invalid input (e.g. 
                <tt>"3w5"</tt>) or strings that are longer than eight characters. Do not use implicit type 
                casting (e.g. <tt>1 * "123"</tt>), and do not use any inbuilt Javascript conversion functions.
            </p>

            <h2>Let's eat Pie in Monte Carlo!</h2>
            <p>
                Sorry, it's not about travelling nor culinaric finesse, but about the Monte Carlo method of computation! 
                Today we'll use it to compute the number &pi; (which is something in the region of 3.14). The idea
                goes as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine a square piece of paper with a side length of 1 meter. On it we draw a quarter 
                circle with a radius of 1 meter and the center point on one of the corners of the 
                paper:<br/>
                <img src="course/it001/lessons/09/img/02.png"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we put the paper on the floor next to a table. Then we climb on the table and
                empty a pepper shaker all over the paper. After some shaking, the paper will look 
                peppered like this:<br/>
                <img src="course/it001/lessons/09/img/03.png"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we count the number of pepper grains inside the quarter circle, and the total number of 
                grains on the paper. Here comes the surprise: The relationship between both counts will 
                somehow contain an approximate of the number &pi; (PI = 3.14)!
            </p>
            <p>
                After the long intro - here's your exercise: Write a program which simulates the above paper 
                and pepper method to calculate an approximate value of the number &pi; (and print it to the console)! 
            </p>

            <h2><a name="ex_stackitup"></a>StackItUp!</h2>
            <p>
                A data structure which is often used in computing is the <em>stack</em>. It's mostly used when 
                a program needs to remember data for later use, before going off to do something else. A stack 
                inserts and retrieves data items at one end. Inserting an item is called <em>pushing</em>, and 
                retrieving an item is called <em>popping</em>. Any popped item is removed from the stack. This
                works quite similar to adding and removing coins to/from a stack:<br/>
                <img src="course/it001/lessons/09/img/04.png"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your task (should you accept it; personally I think you have little choice in this matter), is 
                to write a program which implments a stack. The program must support these operations:
            </p>
            <table class="itemization">
                <tr>
                    <td><tt>Push (item)</tt></td>
                    <td>Pushes <tt>item</tt> onto the stack.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><tt>item = Pop ()</tt></td>
                    <td>Returns the stack's top element and deletes it from the stack.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><tt>n = GetSize ()</tt></td>
                    <td>Returns the curent number of elements stored in the stack.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Together with these operations, identify weaknesses in your design and address these by 
                building in some security - e.g. ensuring that an error message is printed to the console if
                someone tries to pop an element off an empty stack!
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                Javascript has got some inbuilt functions related to pushing onto / popping from stacks 
                (e.g. <tt>Aray.push ()</tt>, <tt>Array.pop ())</tt>, but don't use these! Instead, write 
                your own code which does the pushing and popping!
            </div>

            <h2>All backwards...</h2>
            <p>
                Using the stack design you developed in the <a target="_blank" href="#ex_stackitup">previous exercise</a>, 
                write a program which reverses a string!
            </p>

            <h2>Simultanelicious!</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a system of simultaneous equations:
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    2a + 5b = 29
                    7a - 2b = 4
                </pre>                      
            </div>
            <p>
                The solution to this system is <tt>a = 2</tt>, <tt>b = 5</tt>. Here's a system which is unsolvable, 
                because it does not have any solution:
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    2x + 3y = 5
                    2x + 3y = 4
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                And here's a system which is unsolvable because it does have an infinite amount of solutions:
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
                    x + y = 2
                    x + y = 2
                </pre>                            
            </div>
            <p>
                Write a program which takes any system of two equations with two variables as input and either 
                provides the solution or indicates that the system is unsolvable!
